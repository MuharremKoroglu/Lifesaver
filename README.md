## <h2> About This App <img src = "https://c.tenor.com/JsoERRQcZqYAAAAi/thumbs-up-joypixels.gif" width = "42"></h2>
This application is a dog rescue application. Parse database was used for the application. In order to use the Parse database, pod files were first loaded with Cocoapods. Then the Back4app website was used for the database interface. When the application is first opened, the user is greeted with a login screen using a special font. Users who have logged in before can log in on this screen. A new user is created by clicking the register button. Here we get the user's information with an ImageView and three textFields. After the user clicks on the Register button, a confirmation e-mail is sent to the user thanks to the log out method. The user performs the verification process by clicking on the website in this e-mail. After the verification process, the user is ready to login. Also, we placed a forgot password button on the login page. When clicked here, the user must enter the textField and e-mail address given on the page that opens. You can reset your password by going to the website that comes to your e-mail address and log in again. After logging in, a TableView structure welcomes the user. Here, the flow of the states we add is created. The NavigationBar, which is located above the TableView structure, has been used quite sparingly. The name of the application is written in a special font in the middle of the bar. Then a plus button was added to the right side. In this way, the user will be able to add a new status. Apart from that, there is an account button on the left side of the NavigationBar. By clicking here, you can view the username, e-mail address and picture of the currently logged in user. When the user clicks the plus button, a status is requested to be added. Here, the dog's gender, type and current problem should be added to the TextField structures. Then a picture should be added so that users can easily find the dog. The information entered here is transferred to the next screen with the next button thanks to a Singleton model. Here, the user must specify the dog's position with an annotation. Then, the Singleton model is saved to the database with the latitude and longitude information obtained from here. After registration, the application is automatically redirected to the streaming page. Here the type of dog added and the problem are displayed in the TableView. The user can click on them if desired. After clicking, the IDs of the information we clicked and the information in the database are compared and matched. In this way, we can show the data we clicked on the detail screen. On the detail screen, there are three TextFields. Here the dog's gender, breed and problem are drawn from the database and written. Then again, the dog's picture and the latitude longitude information from the database are shown on the map. In addition, we have slightly customized the annotation structure so that the user can go directly to the dog. In this way, we put a button and when the user clicks this button, the navigation opens. The opened navigation creates the fastest route in the driving mode, allowing the user to reach the dog in the fastest way. Finally, code readability has been increased and unnecessary structures have been eliminated.
